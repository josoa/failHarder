Notes: 

start with personal experience avoiding failure
	being told I was "smart" & believing that corresponded to my ability to get something right immediately
	being afraid of being seen as "dumb"
	avoiding things I didn't get immediately

	how many of you can relate to that feeling? 

oftentimes, when we don't pick up on something immediately, it makes us feel like failures 

why?

we know that learning is a process- when we're young and learning something new, we're often told things like, "no one get it right the first time" or "practice makes perfect (or better)"

somehow, we seem to forget that as we get older

if we can return to this mindset that learning is a process and not an instantaneous thing, then we make room for failure. 

why is it important for us to stop fearing failure? 

when we fear failure, we stop ourselves from achieving great success

let's start by looking at what failure really is.

failure is the "lack of success".

success is the "accomplishment of an aim or purpose".

so, failure simply means "it's not over yet".
	it's the word we use to describe the process that happens between the initiation of learning and the achievement of a goal
	sometimes, that process takes a very long time
		talk about Walt Disney

so I want to help equip people to persevere through those times of not being successful in order to achieve their big dreams

the way I decided to do that is through a campaign I call "fail harder", inspired by the push pin mural at wieden & kennedy in portland

the tagline of the campaign is "if you're not failing, you're not (fill in the blank)"

a series of ads appearing on bus benches fill in the blank with various words
one of them is left blank to encourage the viewer's participation

these ads direct the viewer to a website 
the site centers around community- connections to a group of like-minded people who are there to support, encourage, and teach each other
that it also highlights famous failures and provides resources like artcles and videos 

what's in store for fail harder? 
	eventually, fail harder will make its way into middle and high schools, empowering kids to fail boldly, and awarding the students who learn the most rather than simply make good grades. 
	one day, we would like to take fail harder abroad and empower people everywhere. 

we're dreaming big but starting small. here, in this room. i hope you leave today and think of your own way to fill in the blank. if you're not failing, what are you doing?
